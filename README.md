# joecode-unity-contrib
A collection of useful scripts that I use across most of my Unity projects. The nature of the scripts usually fall somewhere between "debugging", "shorthands", or "general utility".

Despite the assembly reference (which is just to save compile time), most pieces of the repository should be independant and easily dropped in wherever needed.
